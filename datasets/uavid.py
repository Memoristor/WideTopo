    UAVid is a high-resolution UAV semantic segmentation dataset as a complement, which brings

    consistency preservation. The UAV dataset consists of 30 video sequences capturing 4K high-resolution
    images in slanted views. In total, 300 images have been densely labeled with 8 classes for
    the semantic labeling task.
